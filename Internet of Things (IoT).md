# Internet of Things (IoT)

[TOC]

## definition

(Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X15003015) 

* IoT refers to “a world-wide network of interconnected objects uniquely addressable, based on standard communication protocols”

Source: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118647059.ch1

* The internet of things (IoT) aims at closing the gap between objects in the material world, the “things,” and their logical representation in information systems. 

## Cloud IoT

(Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X15003015)

* The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is based on intelligent and self configuring nodes (things) interconnected in a dynamic and global network infrastructure.
* IoT is generally characterized by **real world small things, widely distributed, with limited storage and processing capacity**, which involve concerns regarding reliability, performance, security, and privacy.
*  Cloud computing has virtually unlimited capabilities in terms of **storage and processing power**, is a much more mature technology, and has most of the IoT issues at least partially solved.
  * **Definition** “Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction”.
* **Middleware.** Due to the heterogeneity of the participating objects, to their limited storage and processing capabilities and to the huge variety of applications involved, a key role is played by the middleware between the things and the application layer, whose main goal is the abstraction of the functionalities and communication capabilities of the devices.

| Storage                    | Limited or none      | Virtually unlimited           |
| Role of the Internet       | Point of convergence | Means for delivering services |
| Big data                   | Source               | Means to manage               |



*  IoT can benefit from the virtually unlimited capabilities and resources of Cloud to compensate its technological constraints 
* Cloud can benefit from IoT by extending its scope to deal with real world things in a more distributed and dynamic manner, and for delivering new services in a large number of real life scenarios.

##### Cloud help IoT

* **Problems** : Being IoT characterized by a very high heterogeneity of devices, technologies, and protocols, it lacks different important properties such as **scalability, interoperability, flexibility, reliability, efficiency, availability, and security.** 
* Cloud facilitates the flow between IoT data collection and data processing, and enables rapid setup and integration of new things, while maintaining low costs for deployment and for complex data processing  
* As a consequence, analyses of unprecedented complexity are possible, and data-driven decision making and prediction algorithms can be employed at low cost, providing means for increasing revenues and reduced risks.
* Communication
  * Cloud offers an effective and cheap solution to connect, track, and manage any thing from anywhere at any time by using customized portals and built-in apps 
  * The availability of high speed networks enables effective monitoring and control of remote things, their coordination, their communications, and real-time access to the produced data.
  * It can still represent a bottleneck in some scenarios
* Storage
  * IoT involves by definition a large amount of information sources (i.e., the things), which produce a huge amount of non-structured or semi-structured data -> volumn, variety, velocity
  * Cloud is the most convenient and cost effective solution to deal with data produced by IoT

* Computation
  * IoT devices have limited processing and energy resources
  * Cloud offers virtually unlimited processing capabilities and an on-demand usage model.
