# Internet of Things (IoT)

## definition

(Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X15003015) 

* IoT refers to “a world-wide network of interconnected objects uniquely addressable, based on standard communication protocols”

## Cloud IoT

(Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X15003015)

* The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is based on intelligent and self configuring nodes (things) interconnected in a dynamic and global network infrastructure.
* IoT is generally characterized by real world small things, widely distributed, with limited storage and processing capacity, which involve concerns regarding reliability, performance, security, and privacy.
*  Cloud computing has virtually unlimited capabilities in terms of storage and processing power, is a much more mature technology, and has most of the IoT issues at least partially solved.
  * **Definition** “Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction”.
* **Middleware.** Due to the heterogeneity of the participating objects, to their limited storage and processing capabilities and to the huge variety of applications involved, a key role is played by the middleware between the things and the application layer, whose main goal is the abstraction of the functionalities and communication capabilities of the devices.

| Reachability               | Limited              | Ubiquitous                    |
| Components                 | Real world things    | Virtual resources             |
| Computational capabilities | Limited              | Virtually unlimited           |
| Storage                    | Limited or none      | Virtually unlimited           |
| Role of the Internet       | Point of convergence | Means for delivering services |
| Big data                   | Source               | Means to manage               |



*  IoT can benefit from the virtually unlimited capabilities and resources of Cloud to compensate its technological constraints 
* Cloud can benefit from IoT by extending its scope to deal with real world things in a more distributed and dynamic manner, and for delivering new services in a large number of real life scenarios.
