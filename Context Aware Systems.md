# Context Aware Systems

Ref : 

* Context-aware systems are able to adapt their operations to the current context without explicit user intervention and thus aim at increasing usability and effectiveness by taking environmental context into account.
  * services react specifically to their current location, time and other environment attributes and *adapt their behaviour according to the changing circumstances* as context data may change rapidly
* The needed **context information** may be retrieved in a variety of ways, such as applying sensors, network information, device status, browsing user profiles and using other sources.
* context instances can be classified as:
