* IoT  = a world-wide network of heterogeneous cyberphysical objects such as sensors, actuators, smart devices, smart objects, RFID, embedded computers. 
  * From a networking perspective, IoT represents an ecosystem of interconnected "cyberphysical things" that are uniquely addressable, provide specific services and communicate through standard protocols  
  * **Such things can be deployed and exploited in different physical environments to support diversified cyberphysical applications domains.** 

* objects which have identities, physical attributes, and communication interface for service provision, are uniquely addressable and based on standard communication protocols 
* a smart objects-oriented IoT that is modeled as a loosely coupled, decentralized system of cooperative smart objects (CSOs). 



## multi-agent systems (MAS) 

* agents are networked software entities that can perform specific tasks for a user and have a degree of intelligence that permits them to perform parts of their tasks autonomously and to interact with their environment in a useful manner. 
* Agents are characterized by important features (e.g. autonomy, sociality, rationality, responsiveness, proactiveness, situatedness, mobility)
