* IoT  = a world-wide network of heterogeneous cyberphysical objects such as sensors, actuators, smart devices, smart objects, RFID, embedded computers. 
  * From a networking perspective, IoT represents an ecosystem of interconnected "cyberphysical things" that are uniquely addressable, provide specific services and communicate through standard protocols  
  * **Such things can be deployed and exploited in different physical environments to support diversified cyberphysical applications domains.** 
* objects which have identities, physical attributes, and communication interface for service provision, are uniquely addressable and based on standard communication protocols 
* a smart objects-oriented IoT that is modeled as a loosely coupled, decentralized system of cooperative smart objects (CSOs).

* "smart objects" = real artifacts augmented with computing, communication, sensing/actuation and storing functionalities. 



## multi-agent systems (MAS) 

* agents are networked software entities that can perform specific tasks for a user and have a degree of intelligence that permits them to perform parts of their tasks autonomously and to interact with their environment in a useful manner. 
* Agents are characterized by important features (e.g. autonomy, sociality, rationality, responsiveness, proactiveness, situatedness, mobility) 



## Smart Environment

* SOs are able to collaborate and to support Ambient Intelligence  in order to build so called *Smart Environments* (SEs)  
* SE can be defined as a cyber- physical environment augmented with a collection of embedded systems elaborat- ing heterogeneous data and interacting with people. In the literature many different definitions of SE do exist, among them

### requirements:

#### Specific requirements for smart environment middlewares

1. Abstraction over heterogeneous input and output hardware devices
   * Abstractions are needed to virtualize them and let them be used as they were homo- geneous by following a kind of “plug-and-play” paradigm 
2. *Abstraction over hardware and software interfaces* 
   - need to be made generic and standardized through higher level mech- anisms so that their use will be straightforward. 
   - seamlessly interact 
3. *Abstraction over data streams (continuous or discrete data or events) and data types* 
   - abstractions are needed to formalize data streams generated by such components 
   - should be defined under a common framework 
   - representation of data types needs to be standardized.
     - interoperability in data exchange among heterogeneous components. 
4. *Abstraction over physicality (location, context)* 
   1. static or dynamic locations and refer to one or multiple contexts during their lifecycle. 
   2. Abstractions are therefore needed to capture and provide the concepts of location and context as they are useful in the design and implementation of smart environment applications.
5. *Abstraction over the development process* 
   1. suitable methods and tools need to be defined that are able to effectively model them by using high-level abstractions and fully support their implementation and deployment 



#### Specific requirements for smart object middlewares 

1. *Heterogeneity and Application Development* 
   - should be programmed independently 
   - applications should be able to exploit SOs that will be built in the future. 
   - This implies to employ a standard- ized approach 
2. *Augmentation Variation of Smart Objects* 
   - different SOs can provide the same services whereas two similar SOs can provide differ- ent services. 
   - Augmentation variation of SOs is an important requirement as it defines how SOs can variate their augmentation by providing diversified services that can change during their lifecycle. 
3. *Management of Smart Object* 
   - Applications and SOs should be therefore able to dinamically adapt as SOs could continuously change for different purposes 
   - Thus, the matching among SO services and application requirements should be done often at run-time. 
   - Discovery services are therefore strategic in such a dynamic context to look up and retrieve SOs according to their static and dynamic properties. 
4. *Evolution of Smart Object Systems* 
   - be simply and rapidily prototyped and upgraded through proper programming abstractions.
