# Cyber - Physical System (CPS)

## Definition

* Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are physical and engineered systems whose operations are monitored, coordinated, controlled and integrated by a computing and communication core. This intimate coupling between the cyber and physical will be manifested from the nano-world to large-scale wide-area systems of systems.  (Source: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1837461)





### Why adopt CPS?

(Source: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1837461)

#### Push

* the proliferation of low-cost and increased-capability sensors of increasingly smaller form factor
* the availability of low- cost, low-power, high-capacity, small form-factor computing devices
* the wireless communication revolution
* abundant internet bandwidth
* continuing improvements in energy capacity, alternative energy sources and energy harvesting. 

#### Pull

* Business unit increasingly finding that the technology base to build large-scale safety-critical CPS correctly, affordably, flexibly and on schedule is seriously lacking
