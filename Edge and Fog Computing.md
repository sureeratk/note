# Edge and Fog Computing

## Definition

* The ‘edge’ refers to computing infrastructure that exists close to the origin sources of data. 
  * It is distributed IT architecture and infrastructure where data is processed at the periphery of the network, as close to the originating source as possible.
* Edge computing is a method of optimizing cloud computing systems by performing data processing at the edge of the network, near the source of the data.
* ​									

## Pros

* **Time-sensitive data** can be processed at the point of origin by a localized processor
* **Intermediary servers** can be used to process data in close geographical proximity to the source
* **Edge application services** significantly decrease the volumes of data that must be moved, the consequent traffic, and the distance the data must travel, thereby reducing transmission costs, shrinking latency, and improving quality of service(QoS)
* **Security improves as encrypted data**



## Why the edge

* **Transmitting massive amounts of data** is expensive and taxing on network resources.
* Edge computing allows you to process data near the source and only send relevant data over the network to an intermediate data processor.

## Device Relationship Management (DRM)

> Device relationship management (DRM) is enterprise software that enables the monitoring, managing, and servicing of intelligent devices over the Internet. -TechTarget

## The Fog

Between the edge and cloud is the **fog** layer, which helps bridge the connections between edge devices and cloud data centers

> **Fog computing** pushes intelligence down to the local area network level of network architecture, processing data in a fog node or IoT gateway.

> **Edge computing** pushes the intelligence, processing power and communication capabilities of an edge gateway or appliance directly into devices like programmable automation controllers (PACs).



## Realtime API Infrastructure

> Realtime is about pushing data as fast as possible — it is automated, synchronous, and bi-directional communication between endpoints at a speed within a few hundred milliseconds.

- *Synchronous* means that both endpoints have access to data at the same time.
- *Bi-directional* means that data can be sent in either direction.
- *Endpoints* are senders or receivers of data (phone, tablet, server).
- *A few hundred milliseconds* is a somewhat arbitrary metric since data cannot be delivered instantly, but it most closely aligns to what humans perceive as realtime ([Robert Miller](http://theixdlibrary.com/pdf/Miller1968.pdf) proved this in 1986).
