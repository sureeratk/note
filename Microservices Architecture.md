[TOC]

## What

* Â method of developing software systems and applications utilizing independent, small, modular and loosely associated services. [src](https://blog.vivifyideas.com/microservices-architecture-when-to-use-them-e72f349f1ff2)

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

* Each microservice can be developed independently
* A microservice can be deployed independently
* It is possible to change and redeploy only the related service instead of modifying and redeploying the entire application
* Fault isolation
* Microservices are easily scaled and integrated with third-party services

### Cons

* Distributed deployment can result in more complex and tiresome testing
* Information barriers can appear as the number of microservices increases
