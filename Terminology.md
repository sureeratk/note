#Terminology

## context

* Moderators et al [5] define context as any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity. An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and application themselves. 
* Chen et al [6] define context as the set of environmental states and settings that either determines an applicationâ€™s behavior or in which an application event occurs and is interesting to the user. Chen et al. added the time context to the Shilt et al. definitions.
