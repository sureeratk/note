## Simulation Concept

(source: INTRODUCTION TO MODELING AND SIMULATION by John S. Carson II Proceedings of the 2004 Winter Simulation Conference )

* A model is a representation of a system or process

* A simulation model is a representation that incorporates time and the changes that occur over time.

* A discrete model is changes only a discrete points in time, not continuously

  

* Discrete event model -> state changes only at discrete times (event times)

* **Discrete event model** concept :

  * state = state of each entity at the process time
  * events = an instantaneous occurrence that changes the model's state
    * primary event driven by data
    * secondary event generated internally by model logic
  * activities = duration of time that is initiated by the event in conjunction with the model being in a certain sate
  * processes = a sequence of events, activities and other time delays associated with one entity as it flow through a system

* **Entity** = Object of the model

  * dynamic entities are create at time zero
  * Usually represent some real-world object that is flow through a system

### Modelling vs Simulation 1

#### Modelling
* Modeling is the process of producing a model; 
* A model is a representation of the construction and working of some system of interest. 
* A model is similar to but simpler than the system it represents.
  * A model should be a close approximation to the real system and incorporate most of its salient features but should not be so complex that it is impossible to understand and experiment with it 
  * A good model is a judicious tradeoff between realism and simplicity 
* An important issue in modeling is model validity. 
  * simulating the model under known input conditions and comparing model output with system output 

#### Simulation

* A simulation of a system is the operation of a model of the system. 
  * The model can be reconfigured and experimented with 
* simulation is a tool to evaluate the performance of a system, existing or proposed, under different configurations of interest and over long periods of real time. 

### Modelling vs Simulation 2

- **Modelling** means creating a physical replica or equations of a situation or activity.Â 
  - A model is a product (physical or digital) that represents a system of interest

- **Simulation** is a process where you show virtually ( you create virtual scenes ) how a real physical situation would happen.
  - A simulation is the process of using a model to study the behavior and performance of an actual or theoretical system. In a simulation, models can be used to study existing or proposed characteristics of a system.

While a model aims to be true to the system it represents, a simulation can use a model to explore states that would not be possible in the original system.

### Simulation Model

Simulation models  has 4 components:

1. system entities
2. input variables
3. performance measures
4. functional relationships

## Discrete Event Simulation (DES) 

### Definition

* *discrete event simulation* in which the central assumption is that the system changes instantaneously in response to certain discrete events
