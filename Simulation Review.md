#### Modelling
* Modeling is the process of producing a model; 
* A model is a representation of the construction and working of some system of interest. 
* A model is similar to but simpler than the system it represents.
  * A model should be a close approximation to the real system and incorporate most of its salient features but should not be so complex that it is impossible to understand and experiment with it 
  * A good model is a judicious tradeoff between realism and simplicity 
* An important issue in modeling is model validity. 
  * simulating the model under known input conditions and comparing model output with system output
